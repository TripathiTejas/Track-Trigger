# Track-Trigger
It is very difficult to recall and control the availability of mandatory commodities in a
metropolitan home now-a-days because of hectic work schedules. 
We have thus made an effort to create an integrated android application to keep 
track of routine tasks and to help individuals handle everyday home inventories.<br/>
# ANDROID REQUIREMENTS
• Min API level 16<br/>
• Min RAM requirements 1GB<br/>
• Min ROM storage 15MB<br/>
• Min SDK Version 16, Target SDK Version 30<br/>
# FUNCTIONALITIES
The app provides the user with three login options for verification. App employs firebase 
authentication. Therefore, the user can login through multiple devices using the credentials.<br/>
➢ Via Email<br/>
➢ Via Phone Number<br/>
➢ Via Google account<br/>
While registration, no field can be left empty. Password is validated with the help of regular 
expressions and is considered valid if and only if it follows the following constraints:<br/>
➢ It contains at least 8 characters and at most 20 characters.<br/>

➢ Personal Diary<br/>
➢ To-Do List<br/>
ii) Additional fields can be dynamically added which follows the interface of 
Groceries/Home Bills/Personal Diary.<br/>
iii) Data is maintained on a cloud database. Hence, the information can be retrieved if one 
looses his/her device.<br/>

• GROCERIES/ HOME BILLS/ PERSONAL DIARY:<br/>
i) User can keep track of their inventories by adding them and updating the fields 
whenever sees fit.<br/>
ii) User can maintain a personal diary with custom images where user can note important 
work accomplished in a day.<br/>
iii) User can keep a track of his/her household bills such as electricity, water, gas etc. in 
the HOME BILLS category.<br/>
iv) User can attach photos to fields under each category for reference. Each field can be 
edited, shared and deleted.<br/>
v) Data is maintained on a cloud database. Hence, the information can be retrieved if the 
user loses his/her device.<br/>
• To-Do List:<br/>
➢ The user can schedule reminders for important tasks at the desired time.<br/>
